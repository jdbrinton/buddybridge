# Terms of Service for BuddyBridge

Effective Date: January 1, 2025

Thank you for using BuddyBridge! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of BuddyBridge, a self-hosted, open-source application. By downloading, installing, or using BuddyBridge, you agree to the following Terms.

## 1. Open-Source Code and Licensing
BuddyBridge is open-source software distributed under the MIT license. You are free to use, modify, and distribute the source code in accordance with the MIT license, available in the repository at https://github.com/jdbrinton/buddybridge.

These Terms apply only to your use of the BuddyBridge application itself and do not limit or restrict your use of the source code as governed by the MIT license.

## 2. Self-Hosting Responsibility
BuddyBridge is a self-hosted application. You are solely responsible for hosting, configuring, and running the application on your own device or infrastructure. The maintainers of BuddyBridge provide the source code "as is" and are not responsible for its deployment, maintenance, or operation.

## 3. Third-Party Services
BuddyBridge interacts with third-party platforms, including but not limited to Facebook and Bluesky, to perform its intended functionality (e.g., logging in, scraping your friends list, and attempting to match them across platforms). 

It is your responsibility to ensure that your use of BuddyBridge complies with the terms of service, policies, and guidelines of these third-party platforms. Specifically:
- Many platforms, such as Facebook, explicitly prohibit automated scraping, even if performed on your own account and device.
- BuddyBridge employs techniques like headless browser automation to interact with third-party platforms, which may be in violation of their terms of service, regardless of the device or environment in which it is used.

**I have not verified whether the use of BuddyBridge complies with the terms of service of any third-party platform.** By using BuddyBridge, you acknowledge and accept full responsibility for ensuring compliance with the applicable terms of service of any platform you interact with while using the application.

Before using BuddyBridge, I strongly recommend:
- Reviewing the terms of service and policies of the third-party platforms you intend to use it with.
- Determining whether your intended use is permitted under those terms.

The maintainers of BuddyBridge disclaim any liability for actions taken by third-party platforms as a result of your use of this application, including but not limited to account suspensions, bans, or legal actions.

## 4. Data Handling and Privacy
BuddyBridge processes your login credentials and data locally on your device. The application does not transmit or store your data on any external servers. However, the maintainers of BuddyBridge are not responsible for how you configure or use the application, including any potential data exposure resulting from misconfiguration or unauthorized access to your device.

## 5. Disclaimer of Warranties
BuddyBridge is provided "as is," without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. The maintainers of BuddyBridge do not guarantee that the application will function without errors or interruptions, or that it will remain compliant with third-party platform terms of service over time.

## 6. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the maintainers of BuddyBridge shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the application, including but not limited to:
- Violations of third-party terms of service.
- Account suspensions or bans from third-party platforms.
- Loss of data or security breaches resulting from the use of BuddyBridge.

## 7. Changes to the Terms
These Terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of BuddyBridge after changes to the Terms constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 8. Contact
